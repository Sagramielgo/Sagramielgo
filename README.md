## Hi there 👋, I am Sagramielgo, Sagra for my friends <a href="https://twitter.com/sagramielgo"><img src="https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/sagramielgo.svg?style=social" align="right"/></a>

I am an artist: singer, actress and tv host 🗞 and I am passionate by user experience and accessibility. Because of this, I decided run into the coding career 👩‍💻 and continue improving my knowledge and skills.

:rocket: I'm focused on:

- HTML5, CSS3, Sass;
- JavaScript (with ReactJS) and third-party web services (APIs);
- Version control with Git;
- Creation of SPAs with React;
- Node JS and Express.

:round_pushpin: [@Adalab](https://github.com/Adalab) was my first school, and I want to continue studying to become a full-stack developer and contribute to large projects.

But in between, I would also love to have a good conversation about:

- :coffee: Coffee
- 🎬 Series (I am always open to suggestions)
- 🎸

Let's talk!

## A little more about me:
