## Hi there 👋, I am Sagramielgo, Sagra for my friends <a href="https://twitter.com/sagramielgo"><img src="https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/sagramielgo.svg?style=social" align="right"/></a>

## I am an artist: singer, actress and tv host. And now also PROUD PROGRAMMER 💻.

I always wanted to be a singer 🎼, a teacher 📖 and an astronaut 👩‍🚀.
With effort and dedication I studied Philology, singing, music and theatre; my professional experience has been linked to music, communication, tv and radio 📺.

I have travelled around the world, I have worked in Japan, Argentina, UK and different Spanish cities. I am an inquisitive person, cultural diversity lover and passionate about comparative linguistics.

I am self-taught in editing my own audio-visual material, my computer has been my travel partner.
I am tenacious and committed, and a disciplined sports person.

All these experiences helped me develop technical and managerial skills, such as: adaptability and empathy to understand the needs of each project. I overcame adversities with other people's help, that is why, at work and in my personal life, I believe in team work.

Formed in [@Adalab](https://github.com/Adalab) I am taking off as a front-end developer with enthusiasm. Houston, the countdown is starting 🚀.

Take a look to one of my project demos 📽️ [devRockets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdzEJnlMqdA)
And also you can sing (lyrics in Spanish) this song I wrote about programming 🎵 [Indéntame] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmcnZGeIjNk&t=2s)

I'm focused on:

- HTML5, CSS3, Sass;
- JavaScript (with ReactJS) and third-party web services (APIs);
- Version control with Git;
- Creation of SPAs with React;
- Node JS and Express.
- Agile & SCRUM

I would also love to have a good conversation about:

- 🎬 Series & cinema (I love sci-fy).
- 🎸 Music, specially jazz and real book standards.
- ✈️ Travelling, around the world.
- 🏅 Sports, specially running. I'm a marathon runner, yesssss.
- 🐕 Animals, I love them all.

Let's talk!
