I always wanted to be a singer, a teacher and an astronaut.
My professional experience has been linked to music, communication, tv and radio.

I have travelled around the world, I have worked in Japan, Argentina, UK and different Spanish cities. I am an inquisitive person and a cultural diversity lover.
I am self-taught in editing my own audio-visual material, my computer has been my travel partner.

All these experiences helped me develop technical and managerial skills, such as: adaptability and empathy to understand the needs of each project. At work and in my personal life, I believe in team work.
Formed in [@Adalab](https://github.com/Adalab) I am taking off as a front-end developer with enthusiasm.

Houston, the countdown is starting 🚀.

## A little more about me:

🚧 iAmLookingFor: "fun and creative programming",

}
```

I would also love to have a good conversation about:

- 🎬 Series & cinema (I love sci-fy).
- 🎸 Music, specially jazz and real book standards.
- ✈️ Travelling, around the world.
- 🏅 Sports, specially running. I'm a marathon runner, yesssss.
- 🐕 Animals, I love them all.

Let's talk!
